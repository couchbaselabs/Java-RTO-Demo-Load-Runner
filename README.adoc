Demonstration application for understanding response time observability.

The application uses the Couchbase Java SDK.
It performs random operations against a Couchbase bucket.

The design has been optimized to generate a high request rate.

Build with

`mvn compile`

Run with

`mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="-h"`

For example

`mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="-c localhost -b default -u admin -p password"`

Or package a jar file and run with a vanilla Java command line.

Run

`mvn package`

to create

`target/rto-1.0.jar`

Run with

`java -jar target/rto-1.0.jar -c <cluster> -b <bucket> -u <user> -p <password>`

Options:

See `Options.java` for all the options.

`-r` sets the number of documents taken from the bucket to use in KV operations, which includes mutations and removals.
The documents are cached by the app.


`-s` sets the sample size logged by the threshold tracer

`-K` sets the KV timeout.
Operations taking longer than this will get recorded by the threshold tracer.
(This has no effect with other tracers.)

`-q` sets the number of KV ops to queue before delaying to let them drain.

`-d` sets the delay time to allow ops to drain.  This along with `-q` throttles generation of ops so as not to overrun the SDK internal queue.

`-e` selects the operations to run.  Look at the enum in App.java for the list.  For example, to run just gets, use `-e GET`.

Examples:

`java -Dcom.couchbase.operationTracingEnabled=false -jar target/rto-1.0.jar`

runs with tracing completely disabled.  (`-D` sets a system property.  See the Couchbase Java SDK docs for these.)

`java -jar target/rto-1.0.jar -u admin -p password -K 100 -e GET`

runs against localhost using the travel-sample bucket with KV threshold tracer timeout set to 100ms, and only `get` operations.

`java -DJAEGER_REPORTER_LOG_SPANS=true -jar target/rto-1.0.jar -c ec2-54-215-184-156.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com -u admin -p password -j localhost -t jaeger`

runs with Jaeger tracing enabled (`-t`) and Jaeger on the localhost (`-j localhost`).
